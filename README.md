🚀 FenceTrack – Smart GPS Device for Real-Time Tracking and Geo-Fencing

An interactive React-based dashboard for visualizing real-time GPS device locations, setting up geo-fences, and managing tracking alerts. FenceTrack demonstrates how modern UI/UX design can enhance the experience of monitoring smart GPS devices with engaging visualizations and interactive features.

🌍 Problem Being Solved

Traditional GPS tracking systems often lack an intuitive interface for real-time tracking and geo-fencing management. FenceTrack solves that problem by providing:

Live device tracking on an interactive map.

Geo-fencing setup with instant alerts when devices enter/exit defined boundaries.

Data-driven insights through charts and statistics.

✨ Features
🖥️ User Interface Components

Dashboard with real-time device tracking on a map.

Sidebar navigation for geo-fence setup, alerts, and user settings.

Interactive controls for starting/stopping tracking and managing geo-fences.

📊 Visual Elements

Map integration (Leaflet/Google Maps) with live GPS markers.

Geo-fenced zones highlighted on the map.

Charts & graphs for tracking statistics and history.

🎯 User Engagement Features

Tooltips & modals explaining each feature.

Feedback system for reporting issues and suggestions.

Demo mode showcasing tracking & geo-fencing capabilities.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Frontend Framework: React (with hooks & modular components)

UI Styling: Tailwind CSS (modern, responsive design)

Map Integration: Leaflet.js (or Google Maps API)

Charts: Recharts / Chart.js

State Management: React Hooks (useState, useEffect)

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
